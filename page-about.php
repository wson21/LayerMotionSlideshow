                    More than Furniture,<br>
                    We Build Dreams.

                <p>Founded in the 1980s in Penang, Malaysia under the name Sim Furnishing, we started from a humble beginning providing custom-made wooden furniture for private oresidences and small-time commercial clients. Over the years, our commitment to original craftsmanship, quality materials and workmanship has propelled us by leaps and bounds and enabled us to explore the many facets of interior design, construction and project management. In 2005, our business model was revamped as a total solution provider when the company was incorporated as Simfur Design Sdn. Bhd.</p>
        
                <p>Today, even as we grow in size and scope, our dedication remains true to creating bespoke furniture at a reasonable price. We believe that the best design is a perfect balance between aesthetics and functionality and one that tells the personal story of each client with class and clarity.</p>
